Features that we want:

1. Notes (created using markdown?).

2. Collections / notebooks.

3. Tags.

4. (Relatively) easy incorporation of non-text content like PDFs or images.

5. Distributed.

6. Can work offline.

7. (Controlled) sharing (at the note level? at the notebook level?).
--> I would vote at the notebook level.

8. Revision history for notes.

9. Links point between notes point to the version of the note when the link
was created.

10. Merge / conflict resolution for shared notes, or locks on notes when
"checked out" (less optimal?).
--> I would vote merge/conflict resolution for shared notes. Checking out
notes would be hard to enforce in combination with a distributed approach.

11. The ability to add comments and responses to individual places in notes

12. To do lists and time lines that have time specific events. The ability
to send/display reminders?

13. Compatible with web browsers so that it can be viewed anywhere on any
device.

14. Full compatibility with intellectual property concerns, i.e. the
notebook could be used as valid evidence of timing in patent disputes.
